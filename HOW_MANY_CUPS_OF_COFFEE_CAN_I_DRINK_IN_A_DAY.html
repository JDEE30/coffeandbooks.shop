                        rates of dementia and Alzheimer's, and a reduced risk of depression<strong>. <em>It's also great for your heart, people who drink three or four cups a day maybe&nbsp;19% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease</em></strong><em>.</em>Altschmied
                        said he hoped his new study would debunk the old advice that people with heart problems shouldn't drink coffee, and he argues that drinking the equivalent of about four shots of espresso a day could help reduce the risk of heart
                        attacks, especially for people who are obese or prediabetic."It will not replace other things," he said. "Keep on doing your sports, eat healthy, and add coffee to your diet."If you don't like the taste, green tea has similar levels
                        of caffeine and could also be an effective way to boost heart health.<strong> Necessary caution in the consumption of coffee for healthy people:</strong> Because caffeine can make blood vessels grow, providing more oxygen to fuel
                        tumors, the coffee-drinking advice might not hold for people who have cancer.<strong>"<em>Where people have a diagnosed tumor, we would say better take your hands off the coffee," Altschmied said. "But if you're otherwise healthy, it will not harm you, and it might help your heart and circulatory system stay better functional for a longer time."</em>What other benefits a healthy individual can get by using Three to Four cups of Coffee per day:Decrease Liver Cancer Risk:</strong>&nbsp;Researchers
                        at <strong><em>USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center found that those that consume 1-3 cups of coffee a day have a 29% reduced risk of developing liver cancer</em></strong>. Coffee is also associated with&nbsp;a whole host of
                        other health benefits, including a lower risk of liver disease (cirrhosis), a lower risk of developing certain kinds of cancer, lower rates of dementia and Alzheimer's, and a reduced risk of depression. It's also great for your
                        heart -- people who drink three or four cups a day maybe&nbsp;19% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease<strong>.No More Cavities:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Researchers out of Brazil found
                        that strong black coffee kills the bacteria on teeth that lead to tooth decay. Adding milk or sugar to coffee negates this benefit.&nbsp;<strong>Reduce Gout Risk:</strong> Another study proved that developing gout (in men) decreases
                        with increasing coffee consumption. This is a large study of over 50,000 men<strong>Lower Risk of Death From Cancer And Heart disease:</strong>According to The study published in the&nbsp;June 17, 2008, issue of the ‘‘Annals of
                        Internal Medicine<em>&nbsp;</em>showed that women who consume coffee had a lower risk of death from cancer, heart disease, and other factors, which therefore promotes a&nbsp;longer lifespan. Yet <strong><em>another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that coffee drinkers were at less risk of dying prematurely from diseases like diabetes, heart disease and forms of cancer.</em></strong><br><strong>Prevent from the risk of dying early from disease:</strong>&nbsp;
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another study from Japan found that men who drink at least<strong> <em>3 cups of coffee per day have a 24% less risk of dying early from disease.</em></strong><em> </em>Yet <strong><em>another study from Harvard also confirmed</em></strong>                        that those who drink 1-5 cups of coffee a day avoid diseases linked to premature death.<strong>Oxidative Stress Relief:<em>A&nbsp;Cornell University Study showed that coffee may prevent retinal damage due to oxidative stress</em></strong>.
                        Caffeine isn't the culprit here, but&nbsp;chlorogenic acid (CLA), which is one of the strong antioxidants found in the coffee bean.<strong>Longevity:<em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A Japanese-based study also found similar results when it comes to coffee and longevity</em></strong>.&nbsp;Two&nbsp;more
                        2017 research studies have confirmed what earlier studies have found. Those that drink coffee live longer than those who don't. The American study proved the same as well as the European-based study.<strong>Reduced heart attack mortality: &nbsp;</strong>Researchers
                        found that those who drink two or more cups of coffee daily after having a heart attack have the least risk of dying from the heart attack.<strong>Fight against periodontal disease:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
                        part of the US Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Longitudinal Study coffee &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consumption and dental health among 1,152 men was tracked from 1968-1998. The researchers found that coffee didn't promote gum disease
                        and actually showed a protective benefit.<br><strong>Helps people get along with co-workers better.</strong>&nbsp; A study published in&nbsp;the Journal of Psychopharmacology showed that workers/ workplaces who consume coffee have
                        a more positive view of self and others than do workers/ work places that do not consume coffee. Coffee consumption also enhanced participation in work group activities. This research explores the effect of consuming a moderate
                        amount of commercially available caffeinated coffee on an individual's self-evaluated participation in a group activity and subsequent evaluations of the experience. Across two studies, <strong><em>results show that consuming a moderate amount of caffeinated coffee prior to indulging in a group activity enhances an individual's task-relevant participation in the group activity</em></strong>.
                        In addition, subjective evaluations of the participation of other group members and oneself are also positively influenced. Finally, the positive impact of consuming a moderate amount of caffeinated coffee on the evaluation of
                        participation of other group members and oneself is moderated by a sense of an increased level of alertness.<br> <br><strong>Coffee may protect against melanoma</strong>: A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer
                        Institute found that&nbsp;melanoma risk decreases with coffee consumption and that this risk decreases with each cup consumed<strong>The USDA's new 2015 dietary guidelines recommend&nbsp;it for better health</strong>: They advise
                        people that having 3 to 5 cups of coffee a day is good for their overall health and reduces the risk of disease. However, they report that adding sugar, cream, or flavored creamers quickly negates the potential benefits.<br> <strong>Conclusion:</strong>You
                        can enjoy more benefits of coffee if you drink<strong><em> three to four cups of coffee per day</em></strong>. However, if you exceed the limit, you won't necessarily be a victim to any harm, but the benefits would be lessened.
                        Women are often recommended to drink one to two cups of coffee per day which amounts to 100-200 mg of caffeine per day.<strong><em>"I must say The key is moderation, which is&nbsp;typically 2-3 cups a day, to get the coffee health benefits.</em></strong><br><br><br></p>
