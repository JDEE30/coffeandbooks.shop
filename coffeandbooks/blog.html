The list of business titans, world leaders, and intellectual giants that credit a love of reading is endless. There’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/28/how-reading-fiction-makes-you-smarter.html">science</a>&nbsp;behind
                        the assertion. Reading in general increases your vocabulary and language skills, while fiction reading in particular can improve your emotional intelligence and empathy. Reading&nbsp;<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201704/your-brain-text?amp">changes the brain</a>,
                        as well. The advantage of literate people over those who cannot read is profound, including higher intelligence, increased longevity, and better memory. The practice also thickens the corpus callosum and reduces the chances of
                        dementia.</p><br><p>  There are a few&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/10-reasons-people-read-lot-likely-successful.html"> benefits of reading</a>&nbsp;that are uniquely tied to the mechanics of the act itself. One
                        is the requirement for greater focus than other mediums, and another is enhancing the ability to write well, whether those written words are ultimately read or heard. Beyond that, isn’t it the knowledge and perspective that comes
                        from exposing yourself to information that matters? For many, reading is the most efficient way to consume large amounts of information, but isn’t it still the information itself that allows for success? I, for one, am a reader.
                        While I can binge-watch&nbsp;<em>Chopped</em>&nbsp;for entertainment, when it comes to learning, I have to read. I can’t listen to podcasts or watch instructional videos. Live presentations make me squirm in my seat (if
                        you can get me there in the first place). That being said, I know enough to know that many people are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;like me. Some people are auditory learners, while others need visuals to effectively grasp information.The popularity
                        of podcasts, audio books, and the motivational cassette tapes of old prove the desire for auditory information. And the fact that some people&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/normal/2016/10/06/speed_listening_to_podcasts_is_totally_normal_and_practical.html">speed-listen</a>&nbsp;to
                        podcasts and audio books shows that there is a desire for greater efficiency in auditory learning without resorting to reading. So, while&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;think you should read more, you do you. And if you’re the podcast type,

                        were less likely to die during the study period.You may wonder whether this means that you’ll live longer if you drink a lot of coffee.This short review tells you if drinking coffee can extend your life.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                        stress in your body caused by damaging free radicals.Oxidation is believed to be one of the mechanisms behind aging and common, serious conditions like cancer and heart disease. Coffee happens to be the biggest source of antioxidants
                        in the Western diet — outranking both fruits and vegetables combined (<a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/134/3/562.short">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661807000291">2</a>,&nbsp;

                            treating yourself to a cup of coffee, you're not only getting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-caffeine">caffeine</a>&nbsp;but many other beneficial compounds, including powerful antioxidants.<br>&nbsp;

                            studies show that regular coffee intake is linked to a lower risk of dying from various serious diseases. An important 2012 study on coffee consumption in 402,260 people aged 50–71 observed that those who drank the most coffee
                            were significantly less likely to have died during the 12–13-year study period (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1112010">4</a>). The sweet spot appeared to be a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-coffee-should-you-drink">coffee intake</a>&nbsp;of
                            4–5 cups per day. At this quantity, men and women had a 12% and 16 % reduced risk of early death, respectively. Drinking 6 or more cups per day provided no additional benefit.However, even moderate coffee consumption of just
                            one cup per day was associated with a 5–6% lowered risk of early death — showing that even a little bit is enough to have an effect. Looking at particular causes of death, researchers found that coffee drinkers were less likely
                            to die from infections, injuries, accidents, respiratory disease, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1112010">4</a>). Other more recent studies support these findings. Coffee
                            intake seems to be consistently linked to a lower risk of early death (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5788283/">5</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28693036">6</a>). Keep in mind that
                            these are observational studies, which cannot prove that coffee caused the reduction in risk. Still, their results are a good reassurance that coffee is — at the very least — not to be feared.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                            the past few decades.At least two other studies have shown that coffee drinkers have a lower risk of premature death (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18559841">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21298466">8</a>).Regarding
                            specific diseases, coffee drinkers have a much lower risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type 2 diabetes, and liver diseases — just to name a few (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1468-1331.2002.00421.x/full">9</a>,&nbsp;
                            <a
                                href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.10277/abstract">10 </a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20008687">11 </a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16772246">12</a>). What’s more, studies show that coffee may make you happier, reducing your risk
                                of depression and suicide by 20% and 53%, respectively (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21949167">13</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8604958">14</a>). Thus, coffee may not only add years
                                to your life but also life to your years.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong> Observational studies suggest that drinking coffee reduces your risk of chronic disease and may even extend your life. These types of studies
                                examine associations but cannot prove — beyond doubt — that coffee is the real cause of these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/top-13-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-coffee">health benefits</a>. Nevertheless,
                                higher-quality evidence supports some of these findings, meaning that coffee may well be one of the healthiest beverages on the planet.<br><br></p>

                        While his doctor told the writer and philosopher that his habit would kill him, Voltaire lived to the ripe old age of 83.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>&nbsp;2.
                        SØREN KIERKEGAARD Kierkegaard was like Voltaire in that he needed a little some sweet to cut through coffee’s bitterness. Biographer Joakim Garff writes of his ritual: “Delightedly he seized hold of the bag containing the sugar
                        and poured sugar into the coffee cup until it was piled up above the rim. Next came the incredibly strong, black coffee, which slowly dissolved the white pyramid.” It added up to about 30 sugar cubes in a single cup. He also owned
                        about 50 coffee cups, and tasked his secretary with not only choosing one for each serving, but also providing a sound philosophical reason for the decision.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>3. LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN&nbsp;Beethoven played a
                        strict numbers game when it came to his cup of joe. His morning routine consisted of counting out exactly 60 beans per cup of coffee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>5. L. FRANK The
                        writer of The Wonderful Wizard of Ozwas a morning person. He got up at 8 a.m. every day, ate a hearty breakfast, and downed five cups of strong coffee with cream and sugar. Then he’d visit the garden for some time with the flowers
                        and only begin writing after lunchtime. He’d write in the garden if the weather was nice, with a cigar dangling from his mouth. Now that’s an admirable workday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>6.
                        MARGARET The Canadian poet might be the most emphatic coffee fiend on our list, lending her name to Balzac’s Coffee Roasters’ "Bird Friendly" blend to raise money for Canada’s Pelee Island Bird Observatory. “The Atwood Blend” is
                        mild and contains a “supple, caramel finish,” and will only cost you $18 a pound. In her daily life, Atwood subsists each morning on a breakfast of coffee with cream or steamed milk. In her novel Cat’s Eye, a little of Atwood’s
                        coffee bias takes shape in her prose: “I don’t even glance at the herbal teas, I go straight for the real, vile coffee. Jitter in a cup. It cheers me up to know I’ll soon be so tense.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>7.
                        DAVID LYNCH The mind of David Lynch doesn’t seem like it would need much stimulation, and yet the director reportedly drinks four to seven cups of coffee with sugar each day. The most famous character he created—Dale Cooper from
                        Twin Peaks—was a nut for the stuff, and Lynch even has his own David Lynch Signature Organic Coffee. He's written about his coffee obsession and describes the habit in the sort of feverish nostalgia we’ve come to know and love
                        in his work: “For seven years I ate at Bob’s Big Boy. I would go at 2:30, after the lunch rush. I ate a chocolate shake and four, five, six, seven cups of coffee—with lots of sugar. And there’s lots of sugar in that chocolate shake.
                        It’s a thick shake. In a silver goblet. I would get a rush from all this sugar, and I would get so many ideas! I would write them on these napkins. It was like I had a desk with paper. All I had to do was remember to bring my pen,
                        but a waitress would give me one if I remembered to return it at the end of my stay. I got a lot of ideas at Bob’s.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>8.
                        MARCEL PROUST many of the writers and thinkers on this list seem to get more from consuming more, Proust got his energy from a kind of regimented deprivation. According to his housekeeper, Celeste, the writer had two bowls of black
                        coffee, hot milk and two croissants upon waking in the late afternoon, and then consumed little else. “I’ve never heard of anyone else living off two bowls of café au lait and two croissants a day. And sometimes only one croissant!”
                        she wrote. Proust occasionally did dine out in the evenings, where he reportedly ate enormous quantities. The life of the artist: feast or famine.<p></p><br><br><br><br>

                        Versailles, handpicked them, roasted and ground them, and loved to serve his carefully crafted brew to guests.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>10. GERTRUDE STEIN A deeply held—and
                        cognitive as opposed to physical—appreciation for the virtues of coffee is its own kind of devotion. Of coffee, novelist Stein wrote: “Coffee gives you time to think. It’s a lot more than just a drink; it’s something happening.
                        Not as in hip, but like an event, a place to be, but not like a location, but like somewhere within yourself. It gives you time, but not actual hours or minutes, but a chance to be, like be yourself, and have a second cup.” </p>

                        <p>11. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN Among the Founding Fathers of the United States, Franklin was also a bit of a coffee snob as well as one of the first well-known coffee shop frequenters. Franklin used
                        coffee shops to hold meetings, play chess or just hang out with his friends. When he was in London, he had his mail sent to his favorite Birchin Lane shop (which was common at the time)

                        THOMAS JEFFERSON Franklin wasn’t the only one of our nation’s founders to harbor a serious love for a cup of mud. The Declaration of Independence author called coffee “the favorite drink of the civilized world”—though, admittedly,
                        that might have had a thing or two to do with an aversion to British tea.</p>

                        <p>13. HONORE DE
                        BALZAC Balzac’s work regimen consisted of punctuated periods of intensive work and then pure relaxation—extremes that were aided by caffeine consumption. During periods of work, he ate dinner at 6 p.m., then went to bed, waking
                        at 1 a.m. to work for the next seven hours. The all-nighter was rewarded at 8 a.m. with a nap, and at 9:30 the coffee parade began. Balzac drank as many as 50 cups a day and later as his tolerance rose, he ate pure coffee grounds.
                        He suffered physically for it, plagued with stomach cramps, twitches, headaches and high blood pressure until he died of heart failure at 51. There are a plethora of his powerful, coffee-related quotes out there in the world, but
                        here’s one for the road: “Were it not for coffee one could not write, which is to say one could not live.</p>

                        NAPOLEON BONAPARTE The French military and political leader reportedly asked for a spoonful of coffee while on his deathbed, and the subsequent autopsy revealed coffee grounds in his stomach. He is also responsible for a quote
                        that has appeared on many a coffee cup: “I would rather suffer with coffee than be senseless.</p>

                        JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH Bach loved coffee so much that he literally wrote a song about it: the Coffee Cantata, about a father and his coffee loving daughter. I don’t want to give too much away, but let’s just say that a lot of turmoil
                        ends in a joyous celebration of song and a marriage contract....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! How sweet coffee tastes, more delicious than a thousand kisses, milder than muscatel wine. Coffee, I have to have coffee,and, if someone wants to pamper me, 
                        then bring me coffee as a gift!"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p class="mb-0"><br>With the rise in digital platforms like Amazon offering e-books, a debate has raged within literary community. What format is better, e-books or physical books? As this article will show, physical books have many benefits over
                        e-books.&nbsp;<br><br><br>One of the biggest considerations when comparing these two formats are which format has the most benefits for readers? The biggest positive for the e-book format is that they are light, you can load thousands
                        of books onto the one light device. If you use storage devices like SD cards, the number of novels you can access from that device is potentially unlimited. On the other hand, physical books are often bulkier and heavier. However,
                        physical books are better for your eyes as e-books require you to stare at a screen for extended periods. Additionally, one of the most popular times to read is just before bed. Many doctors recommend avoiding any source of artificial
                        light, such as the screen of an e-reader, before bed as the light may disrupt your sleep rhythms. Also, e-readers have been shown to cause dry eyes because when reading e-books people blink less. So, physical books are better for
                        your eyes than e-books. But what about the overall reading experience?<br><br><br><br>Many proponents of e-books argue that the biggest advantage of digital books is the number of novels available. There is a huge number of books
                        that exist in a purely digital format, much more than printed books. This is because anyone can self-publish online, while the publishing industry goes to great efforts to select the best authors. Additionally, traditionally published
                        books usually have been extensively edited to avoid grammar and spelling mistakes. Physical books help support the economy, their purchase helping to keep book stores open. There are also several charity events based around selling
                        used books, such as Lifeline’s Bookfest. Without physical books these events simply wouldn’t happen. However, we haven’t yet discussed the biggest benefit of owning physical copies of your favourite books.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Many
                        people who prefer physical to digital books cite the intimacy of the reading experience, which e-books simply can’t compete with. No e-reader can replicate the way a book feels in your hands, the smell of the paper, the pleasure
                        of turning the page. For many people, e-books simply can’t replicate the joy of curling up with your favourite print book on a rainy afternoon.&nbsp;<br><br><br>This article has looked at one of the most controversial subjects
                        in the literary world. Ever since e-books came onto the scene, people have been asking whether paper books or e-books are better. As this article has shown, physical books have several advantages over their electronic counterparts.
                        Along with supporting the bookshop industry, physical books also have an intrinsic value that many readers feel e-readers simply cannot replicate. The feeling of holding a book and thumbing through the pages can’t be provided by
                        any e-reader. So, put down your e-book and go to your local book store to purchase your next great read.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        of coffee and why you should enjoy it daily. The taste is great and it also generates a lot of energy, surrounded by variety of health benefits reasons. It can be confirmed that its health benefits are way so many and one has taken
                        coffee at one time or another. Whether you visit various coffee shops, you will be able to choose the various brands prepared .Enjoy cappuccino and experience the great taste as you enhance your body strength and operations. Here
                        is a discussion of those reasons.Benefits of Coffee.Lowers the Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes.Coffee not only contains antioxidants responsible for preventing tissue damage to the body but also contain minerals required by
                        the body to use the insulin effectively. A study conducted in 2012 and published in Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that coffee includes components that inhibit the formation of a substance in the body known as
                        human islet amyloid polypeptide which is known as one of the causative factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Coffee drinkers who consume more than six cups per every day had a 22% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
                        May Help in Protection Against Liver Cirrhosis.The liver is considered one of the essential organs in the body tasked with functions like detoxification of chemicals, bile production, and metabolism among others. Many conditions
                        like hepatitis, fatty liver disease and excessive consumption of alcohol can lead to liver cirrhosis which is a stage whereby the liver tissue is damaged and replaced by scar tissue. Taking two or more cups of coffee daily have
                        shown to lower the risk of cirrhosis by more than 66% according to research published in the journal <em>Hepatology </em>in April 2014. The study concluded that coffee contains an ingredient that protects against cirrhosis, especially
                        alcoholic cirrhosis. Protection from Dementia and Alzheimer ’s disease.Alzheimer's disease (AD) according to Alzheimer's Association is a type of dementia (a general term for memory loss) that causes problems with memory, thinking
                        and behavior whose signs develop slowly and get worse over time and can end up interfering with daily tasks. It is regarded as the most common cause of dementia. <em>The Journal of the American Medical Association</em> published
                        a research study which showed that caffeine found in coffee boosts the functioning of the brain and can improve short-term memory. Drinking three to five cups per day during your middle age has been associated with 65% decrease
                        risk of dementia in later years.Mocha is Good for Concentration and Overall Moods.Mocha is a drink prepared by mixing one part of coffee beverage and two parts of steamed milk and adding chocolate powder or syrup. A recent study
                        published in BMC Nutrition in January 2017 shows that cocoa which is the main component found in chocolate can increase the level of alertness since it increases cerebral blood flow, therefore, improving attention, vigilance, moods,
                        reaction times, energy levels, cognition, and general mental functioning. However, the study indicates that these qualities of cocoa are more effective when mixed with caffeine.Promote Cardiovascular Health and Lower the Risk of
                        Stroke.The new study published in PLOS Biology has found out that caffeine consumption may help improve, protect and strengthen the ability of cardiovascular cells to recover from any damage. The study published in the 26 June
                        issue of the journal <em>Circulation Heart Failure </em>suggests that consuming four European cups of coffee every day may lower the risk of heart failure by 11%. Lower risk of suffering stroke is related to the lower risk of heart
                        failure since coffee drinks such as cappuccino and mocha contain antioxidants such as flavonoids that works to prevent oxidization of LDL cholesterol.Improves Physical Performance and Raises Body Metabolism.Studies show that caffeine
                        can improve physical performance by stimulating the nervous system to break down body fats (metabolism) as well as increase adrenaline levels in the blood which prepares the body for physical exertion. This process avails free
                        fatty acids from the broken body fats to be used as fuel improving athletic performance, weight loss, and endurance during the physical exercise. Therefore it is essential to take a cup of coffee anytime you are heading for physical
                        activity or gym. It is good to note that caffeine is one of the few natural substances that aid fat burning in the body and hence it is found in almost in every commercial fat-burning supplements due to its effectiveness.Coffee
                        is Good for Your Teeth and Protection Against Periodontal Disease.People who consume black coffee regularly are less likely to have cavities; this is according to a study published in the Wall Street Journal. Roasted coffee beans
                        have positive effects on teeth since they contain antibacterial effect against microorganisms like Streptococcus responsible for causing tooth decay. A dental longitudinal study by the US Department of Veteran Affairs confirmed
                        that coffee had a protective advantage and didn’t promote gum disease. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control Parkinson’s disease Symptoms. &nbsp;Parkinson's is a disease which is caused by the death of dopamine-generating
                        neurons in the brain and is the second most popular neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. To date, there is no known cure for this disease, and hence there is more focus on prevention. &nbsp;A research published
                        in the Journal of the American Academy of Neurology in 2012 found that when caffeine is taken daily, it can help in controlling the involuntary movement of people suffering the disease. Reduces Risk of Stress and Depression.Depression
                        which is defined as a chronic mood disorder has severe effects on how a person thinks, feels and goes on with daily activities such as working, eating as well as sleeping which instead has a significant impact on the quality of
                        life. The disease is known to affect twice as many women as men, approximately 20% of women may be affected by depression during their lifetime. In a study published in 2011 by the Havard School of Public Health showed that women
                        who took four or more cups of coffee daily were less likely to suffer from depression by 20%.Lowers the Risk of Certain Types of Cancers.Cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled growth of cells in the body and is one of
                        the leading causes of death in the world. A study by researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) which was released in April 2016 found that consumption of coffee is associated with lower risk of developing colorectal
                        cancer by 26%, this protective benefit with more use. &nbsp;Coffee also appears to be protective against developing liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma HCC) which is one of the most common cancer in the world. There is a 29%
                        reduced risk of getting liver cancer for people who consume one to three cups of coffee daily.There is a lower risk of getting melanoma, which is the most dangerous form of skin cancer with coffee consumption. This is according
                        to a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Prevents Retinal Damage.Chlorogenic acid (CLA), an antioxidant found in the coffee beans may prevent Hypoxia-induced Retinal Degeneration caused by oxidative
                        stress according to a study conducted by Department of Food Science, Cornell University and published in Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. Retinal Degeneration can result in conditions like night blindness and impaired
                        vision.<br><br>Helps People Get Along Well With Co-workers.A study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology revealed that in workplaces that take coffee, people have a more positive view of others and themselves than workplaces

                        inversely associated with the risk of developing gout which is the most common inflammatory arthritis since it reduces excess uric acid in the bloodstream. People suffering from the disease are advised to take coffee to relieve
                        its symptoms. Lowers the Risk of Multiple Sclerosis.A research study published in the Journal of <em>Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry</em> states that caffeine, a component of coffee, has neuroprotective properties which
                        prevent the neural inflammation that leads to developing of multiple sclerosis. It is therefore important to pass by the coffee shop and at least take a minimum of four cups of coffee a day. Coffee Drinkers Have a Stronger DNA.Consumption
                        of dark roast coffee has been reported to decrease the level of spontaneous DNA strands break hence reducing oxidative damage in peripheral white blood cells (WBC). The study which was published in the European Journal of Nutrition
                        also reveals that coffee drinkers have DNA with stronger integrity.May Help You Live Longer and Improve Overall Health.A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of
                        premature deaths from diseases like diabetes, forms of cancer and heart disease. Several studies indicate that taking coffee results in a 20% reduced risk of death in men a 26% in women, over 18-24years. In another study published
                        in 2017 found out that coffee drinkers may enjoy more health benefits than people who don't take coffee.Reduces Risk of Symptomatic Gallstone Disease.Drinking coffee can help lower the risk of symptomatic gallstone disease in women
                        and protect against the same in men. These studies by the Havard School of Public Health also suggest that this is made possible since the caffeine found in coffee triggers the contractions of the gallbladder discouraging stone

                        Fibre Intake and Promotes Regular Digestion.One cup of coffee contains up to 1.8 grams of dietary fiber out of the recommended 20-38 grams. This makes coffee a more reliable supplier of dietary fiber than most foods and vegetables.
                        Fiber is essential since it promotes good digestive health and bowel movement. In a study published in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> in 2017, researchers found that coffee drinkers have a decreased risk of dying from digestive
                        diseases.Prevents/Stops Headaches.Blood vessels increase in size when one experiences a migraine and therefore it is recommended to take coffee in the early stages of a headache so that the caffeine found in coffee can work to
                        decrease the size of blood vessels before they can affect the nerves in the brain. In drugs like Excedrin which is used as a migraine medication, caffeine is one of the main components in the medicine.Helps Reduce Post-Workout

                        habit, affecting how people view this activity. However, is this really the case? Is your morning cup of coffee really doing you harm? Research indicates that this isn’t the case, in fact coffee consumption has numerous benefits.
                        Studies show that coffee can help protect against diseases. It was found that people who drunk coffee had lower risk for Parkinson’s disease, Type Two Diabetes, liver disease and liver cancer. It was also shown that there was no
                        link between coffee consumption and heart disease amongst most coffee drinkers. So, rather than doing us harm, coffee has many positive health effects. But how does regular coffee consumption affect our brain?<br><br><br><br>Coffee

                        rates of dementia and Alzheimer's, and a reduced risk of depression<strong>. <em>It's also great for your heart, people who drink three or four cups a day maybe&nbsp;19% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease</em></strong><em>.</em>Altschmied
                        said he hoped his new study would debunk the old advice that people with heart problems shouldn't drink coffee, and he argues that drinking the equivalent of about four shots of espresso a day could help reduce the risk of heart
                        attacks, especially for people who are obese or prediabetic."It will not replace other things," he said. "Keep on doing your sports, eat healthy, and add coffee to your diet."If you don't like the taste, green tea has similar levels
                        of caffeine and could also be an effective way to boost heart health.<strong> Necessary caution in the consumption of coffee for healthy people:</strong> Because caffeine can make blood vessels grow, providing more oxygen to fuel
                        tumors, the coffee-drinking advice might not hold for people who have cancer.<strong>"<em>Where people have a diagnosed tumor, we would say better take your hands off the coffee," Altschmied said. "But if you're otherwise healthy, it will not harm you, and it might help your heart and circulatory system stay better functional for a longer time."</em>What other benefits a healthy individual can get by using Three to Four cups of Coffee per day:Decrease Liver Cancer Risk:</strong>&nbsp;Researchers
                        at <strong><em>USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center found that those that consume 1-3 cups of coffee a day have a 29% reduced risk of developing liver cancer</em></strong>. Coffee is also associated with&nbsp;a whole host of
                        other health benefits, including a lower risk of liver disease (cirrhosis), a lower risk of developing certain kinds of cancer, lower rates of dementia and Alzheimer's, and a reduced risk of depression. It's also great for your
                        heart -- people who drink three or four cups a day maybe&nbsp;19% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease<strong>.No More Cavities:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Researchers out of Brazil found
                        that strong black coffee kills the bacteria on teeth that lead to tooth decay. Adding milk or sugar to coffee negates this benefit.&nbsp;<strong>Reduce Gout Risk:</strong> Another study proved that developing gout (in men) decreases
                        with increasing coffee consumption. This is a large study of over 50,000 men<strong>Lower Risk of Death From Cancer And Heart disease:</strong>According to The study published in the&nbsp;June 17, 2008, issue of the ‘‘Annals of
                        Internal’’ Medicine<em>&nbsp;</em>showed that women who consume coffee had a lower risk of death from cancer, heart disease, and other factors, which therefore promotes a&nbsp;longer lifespan. Yet <strong><em>another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that coffee drinkers were at less risk of dying prematurely from diseases like diabetes, heart disease and forms of cancer.</em></strong><br><strong>Prevent from the risk of dying early from disease:</strong>&nbsp;
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another study from Japan found that men who drink at least<strong> <em>3 cups of coffee per day have a 24% less risk of dying early from disease.</em></strong><em> </em>Yet <strong><em>another study from Harvard also confirmed</em></strong>                        that those who drink 1-5 cups of coffee a day avoid diseases linked to premature death.<strong>Oxidative Stress Relief:<em>A&nbsp;Cornell University Study showed that coffee may prevent retinal damage due to oxidative stress</em></strong>.
                        Caffeine isn’t the culprit here, but&nbsp;chlorogenic acid (CLA), which is one of the strong antioxidants found in the coffee bean.<strong>Longevity:<em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A Japanese-based study also found similar results when it comes to coffee and longevity</em></strong>.&nbsp;Two&nbsp;more
                        2017 research studies have confirmed what earlier studies have found. Those that drink coffee live longer than those who don’t. The American study proved the same as well as the European-based study.<strong>Reduced heart attack mortality: &nbsp;</strong>Researchers
                        found that those who drink two or more cups of coffee daily after having a heart attack have the least risk of dying from the heart attack.<strong>Fight against periodontal disease:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
                        part of the US Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Longitudinal Study coffee &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consumption and dental health among 1,152 men was tracked from 1968-1998. The researchers found that coffee didn’t promote gum disease
                        and actually showed a protective benefit.<br><strong>Helps people get along with co-workers better.</strong>&nbsp; A study published in&nbsp;the Journal of Psychopharmacology showed that workers/ workplaces who consume coffee have
                        a more positive view of self and others than do workers/ work places that do not consume coffee. Coffee consumption also enhanced participation in work group activities. This research explores the effect of consuming a moderate
                        amount of commercially available caffeinated coffee on an individual’s self-evaluated participation in a group activity and subsequent evaluations of the experience. Across two studies, <strong><em>results show that consuming a moderate amount of caffeinated coffee prior to indulging in a group activity enhances an individual’s task-relevant participation in the group activity</em></strong>.
                        In addition, subjective evaluations of the participation of other group members and oneself are also positively influenced. Finally, the positive impact of consuming a moderate amount of caffeinated coffee on the evaluation of
                        participation of other group members and oneself is moderated by a sense of an increased level of alertness.<br> <br><strong>Coffee may protect against melanoma</strong>: A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer
