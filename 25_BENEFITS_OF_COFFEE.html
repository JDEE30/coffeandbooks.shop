                        of coffee and why you should enjoy it daily. The taste is great and it also generates a lot of energy, surrounded by variety of health benefits reasons. It can be confirmed that its health benefits are way so many and one has taken
                        coffee at one time or another. Whether you visit various coffee shops, you will be able to choose the various brands prepared .Enjoy cappuccino and experience the great taste as you enhance your body strength and operations. Here
                        is a discussion of those reasons.Benefits of Coffee.Lowers the Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes.Coffee not only contains antioxidants responsible for preventing tissue damage to the body but also contain minerals required by
                        the body to use the insulin effectively. A study conducted in 2012 and published in Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that coffee includes components that inhibit the formation of a substance in the body known as
                        human islet amyloid polypeptide which is known as one of the causative factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Coffee drinkers who consume more than six cups per every day had a 22% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
                        May Help in Protection Against Liver Cirrhosis.The liver is considered one of the essential organs in the body tasked with functions like detoxification of chemicals, bile production, and metabolism among others. Many conditions
                        like hepatitis, fatty liver disease and excessive consumption of alcohol can lead to liver cirrhosis which is a stage whereby the liver tissue is damaged and replaced by scar tissue. Taking two or more cups of coffee daily have
                        shown to lower the risk of cirrhosis by more than 66% according to research published in the journal <em>Hepatology </em>in April 2014. The study concluded that coffee contains an ingredient that protects against cirrhosis, especially
                        alcoholic cirrhosis. Protection from Dementia and Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer's disease (AD) according to Alzheimer's Association is a type of dementia (a general term for memory loss) that causes problems with memory, thinking
                        and behavior whose signs develop slowly and get worse over time and can end up interfering with daily tasks. It is regarded as the most common cause of dementia. <em>The Journal of the American Medical Association</em> published
                        a research study which showed that caffeine found in coffee boosts the functioning of the brain and can improve short-term memory. Drinking three to five cups per day during your middle age has been associated with 65% decrease
                        risk of dementia in later years.Mocha is Good for Concentration and Overall Moods.Mocha is a drink prepared by mixing one part of coffee beverage and two parts of steamed milk and adding chocolate powder or syrup. A recent study
                        published in BMC Nutrition in January 2017 shows that cocoa which is the main component found in chocolate can increase the level of alertness since it increases cerebral blood flow, therefore, improving attention, vigilance, moods,
                        reaction times, energy levels, cognition, and general mental functioning. However, the study indicates that these qualities of cocoa are more effective when mixed with caffeine.Promote Cardiovascular Health and Lower the Risk of
                        Stroke.The new study published in PLOS Biology has found out that caffeine consumption may help improve, protect and strengthen the ability of cardiovascular cells to recover from any damage. The study published in the 26 June
                        issue of the journal <em>Circulation Heart Failure </em>suggests that consuming four European cups of coffee every day may lower the risk of heart failure by 11%. Lower risk of suffering stroke is related to the lower risk of heart
                        failure since coffee drinks such as cappuccino and mocha contain antioxidants such as flavonoids that works to prevent oxidization of LDL cholesterol.Improves Physical Performance and Raises Body Metabolism.Studies show that caffeine
                        can improve physical performance by stimulating the nervous system to break down body fats (metabolism) as well as increase adrenaline levels in the blood which prepares the body for physical exertion. This process avails free
                        fatty acids from the broken body fats to be used as fuel improving athletic performance, weight loss, and endurance during the physical exercise. Therefore it is essential to take a cup of coffee anytime you are heading for physical
                        activity or gym. It is good to note that caffeine is one of the few natural substances that aid fat burning in the body and hence it is found in almost in every commercial fat-burning supplements due to its effectiveness.Coffee
                        is Good for Your Teeth and Protection Against Periodontal Disease.People who consume black coffee regularly are less likely to have cavities; this is according to a study published in the Wall Street Journal. Roasted coffee beans
                        have positive effects on teeth since they contain antibacterial effect against microorganisms like Streptococcus responsible for causing tooth decay. A dental longitudinal study by the US Department of Veteran Affairs confirmed
                        that coffee had a protective advantage and didn't promote gum disease. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control Parkinson's disease Symptoms. &nbsp;Parkinson's is a disease which is caused by the death of dopamine-generating
                        neurons in the brain and is the second most popular neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. To date, there is no known cure for this disease, and hence there is more focus on prevention. &nbsp;A research published
                        in the Journal of the American Academy of Neurology in 2012 found that when caffeine is taken daily, it can help in controlling the involuntary movement of people suffering the disease. Reduces Risk of Stress and Depression.Depression
                        which is defined as a chronic mood disorder has severe effects on how a person thinks, feels and goes on with daily activities such as working, eating as well as sleeping which instead has a significant impact on the quality of
                        life. The disease is known to affect twice as many women as men, approximately 20% of women may be affected by depression during their lifetime. In a study published in 2011 by the Havard School of Public Health showed that women
                        who took four or more cups of coffee daily were less likely to suffer from depression by 20%.Lowers the Risk of Certain Types of Cancers.Cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled growth of cells in the body and is one of
                        the leading causes of death in the world. A study by researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) which was released in April 2016 found that consumption of coffee is associated with lower risk of developing colorectal
                        cancer by 26%, this protective benefit with more use. &nbsp;Coffee also appears to be protective against developing liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma HCC) which is one of the most common cancer in the world. There is a 29%
                        reduced risk of getting liver cancer for people who consume one to three cups of coffee daily.There is a lower risk of getting melanoma, which is the most dangerous form of skin cancer with coffee consumption. This is according
                        to a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Prevents Retinal Damage.Chlorogenic acid (CLA), an antioxidant found in the coffee beans may prevent Hypoxia-induced Retinal Degeneration caused by oxidative
                        stress according to a study conducted by Department of Food Science, Cornell University and published in Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. Retinal Degeneration can result in conditions like night blindness and impaired
                        vision.<br><br>Helps People Get Along Well With Co-workers.A study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology revealed that in workplaces that take coffee, people have a more positive view of others and themselves than workplaces
                        that do not. The study also associates coffee consumption with improved participation in work group activities which boosts synergy among workmates.<br>Reduces Risk of Developing Gout.Increase in coffee intake and consumption is
                        inversely associated with the risk of developing gout which is the most common inflammatory arthritis since it reduces excess uric acid in the bloodstream. People suffering from the disease are advised to take coffee to relieve
                        its symptoms. Lowers the Risk of Multiple Sclerosis.A research study published in the Journal of <em>Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry</em> states that caffeine, a component of coffee, has neuroprotective properties which
                        prevent the neural inflammation that leads to developing of multiple sclerosis. It is therefore important to pass by the coffee shop and at least take a minimum of four cups of coffee a day. Coffee Drinkers Have a Stronger DNA.Consumption
                        of dark roast coffee has been reported to decrease the level of spontaneous DNA strands break hence reducing oxidative damage in peripheral white blood cells (WBC). The study which was published in the European Journal of Nutrition
                        also reveals that coffee drinkers have DNA with stronger integrity.May Help You Live Longer and Improve Overall Health.A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of
                        premature deaths from diseases like diabetes, forms of cancer and heart disease. Several studies indicate that taking coffee results in a 20% reduced risk of death in men a 26% in women, over 18-24years. In another study published
                        in 2017 found out that coffee drinkers may enjoy more health benefits than people who don't take coffee.Reduces Risk of Symptomatic Gallstone Disease.Drinking coffee can help lower the risk of symptomatic gallstone disease in women
                        and protect against the same in men. These studies by the Havard School of Public Health also suggest that this is made possible since the caffeine found in coffee triggers the contractions of the gallbladder discouraging stone
                        formation.Helps Make Your Eyes Less Puffy.Caffeine can be used to constrict blood vessels beneath your skin. Making your eyes less puffy can be achieved by placing a used, cooled down coffee grounds on your under eye area for around
                        15 to 20 minutes. Through constricting of the blood vessels, there is reduced swelling, and this makes you look alive and less tired. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Getting Rid of Cellulite. &nbsp;Using a mixture of coffee grounds and coconut
                        oil can help scrub away dimples on your skin after some time. The caffeine found in coffee helps to tighten and moisturize the skin and therefore reducing the appearance of cellulite.Could Help Your Hair GrowA study published in
                        the International Journal of Dermatology in 2007, found that caffeine could be a potential hair growth stimulant for men having a common hair loss condition known as androgenetic alopecia. The study showed that hair follicles treated
                        with caffeine increased by 46% and the life cycle of the hair was extended by 37%.Powerhouse of AntioxidantsA single cup of brewed coffee like cappuccino and mocha latte contains numerous organic nutrients which are essential in
                        the body. They &nbsp;include:Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)Magnesium and niacin (Vitamin B3)Pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5)Manganese and Potassium Cleanses Your Stomach.Coffee as any other diuretic beverage makes you want to urinate often
                        and it is through this process that all the toxins and bacteria are flushed out of the body in the form of urine which instead helps clean the stomach. Black sugarless coffee is the most effective for cleansing the stomach.Increases
                        Fibre Intake and Promotes Regular Digestion.One cup of coffee contains up to 1.8 grams of dietary fiber out of the recommended 20-38 grams. This makes coffee a more reliable supplier of dietary fiber than most foods and vegetables.
                        Fiber is essential since it promotes good digestive health and bowel movement. In a study published in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> in 2017, researchers found that coffee drinkers have a decreased risk of dying from digestive
                        diseases.Prevents/Stops Headaches.Blood vessels increase in size when one experiences a migraine and therefore it is recommended to take coffee in the early stages of a headache so that the caffeine found in coffee can work to
                        decrease the size of blood vessels before they can affect the nerves in the brain. In drugs like Excedrin which is used as a migraine medication, caffeine is one of the main components in the medicine.Helps Reduce Post-Workout
                        Muscle Pain.There is a significant reduction of muscle pain after working out for people with high caffeine consumption; this is explained by the capacity of the caffeine to decrease the sensitivity of pain in the body, this is
                        according to a study conducted in 2003 and published in the <em>Journal of Pain.</em>ConclusionThe above are some of the reasons why you should make coffee drinking a habit for yourself. You should be able to understand the real
                        benefit and therefore when you visit a coffee shop, take some. During cold weather it is mostly preferred as it come a source of instant warmth unlike other beverage. Mix it with water or even some milk. The quality and its function
                        does not change. During long working hours it can also be one that gives you the energy and you can stay awake for long hours without any effect. It is important to note that a lot of research has been conducted regarding this
                        beverage and all the reports always point to the brighter side of taking it. The benefits are way too many to forego.<br><br><br></p>
